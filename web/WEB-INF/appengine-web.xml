        Version history

        [v1]
        Initial proof-of-concept.  Able to fetch profile data and feed posts vis OAuth 2.0 and displays basic statistics.


        [v2]
        First pass at integrating website design.


        [v3]
        Much more mature version.  Fetched all data upon authorization before displaying charts.  Submitted to Facebook.
        Error'd too many times because of long wait time while fetching feed data.


        [v4]
        Cleaned up architecture.  Now displays infographic page as soon as receiving profile data.  Then proceeds to
        request chart data from server via AJAX call afterward, and asynchronously.  Much better performance.  Submitted
        once again to Facebook.  Approved!  Also received finaly version of code.  Now ready to throw away existing
        codebase and start building the real production version of this application.

        Allows App Engine to send multiple requests to one instance in parallel:

    <!--
        HTTP Sessions are disabled by default. To enable HTTP sessions specify:

          <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>

        It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to
        asynchronously write HTTP session data to the datastore:

          <async-session-persistence enabled="true" />

        With this feature enabled, there is a very small chance your app will see
        stale session data. For details, see
        http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html#Enabling_Sessions
      -->
    <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>
